Gameplay
========

- Magicians can summon Imps to damage other Magicians and Imps.
- Each Imp throws fireballs at a random target that is not their
  summoner or another Imp summoned by their summoner. Each fireball
  deals 5 damage.
- Magicians can summon shields to absorb 20 damage.
- All Magician spells cost mana, which regenerates while the Magician
  is not casting any spells.
